Welcome to our CI453 project presentation, the aim of this project was to create a website 
to introduce students starting secondary school to the fundamentals of information, computer 
and network security.


Communication
We considered using various tools/platforms for communication
eg whatsapp, slack. We decided on discord, trello and github
Discord allowed us to keep in contact regularly to approve design ideas, and helped make it easy
to manage the project when delegating tasks. Trello kept us on track with each of the features
we planned to include, and kept the momentum going as tasks were ticked off. Github would not have
been the asset that it was had we not been able to communicate effectively. Managing project files
within a group could not be achieve effectively if we were not all up to date on the project files,
and pushing our updates to the repository. Without communication, we would have had many conflicts
on files, we wouldn't have had files uploaded on time, and other members wouldn't have known when
updated had been pushed.
