    <h1>Common online privacy threats and how to counteract them</h1>
    <h2>There are a number of different ways in which your privacy can be affected online, this can include;</h2>
    <div class="threats"><h2>Backdoor </h2><p>These are bugs or exploits used to bypass security controls and gain access to your device or computer often from outdated or unpatched software.
    </p> 
    <h2> Solution</h2>  <p>Although hard to detect - keep devices up-to-date with the latest patches.
    </p></div>

    <div class="threats"><h2>Direct-Access Attacks</h2><p>An attacker gains physical access to your device or computer.
    </p> 
    <h2> Solution</h2>  <p>Protect your devices in locked rooms/houses/offices when unattended and password protect them.
    </p></div>

    <div class="threats"><h2>Eavesdropping </h2><p>An attacker gains access to a network in order to monitor it and gain information.
    </p> 
    <h2> Solution</h2>  <p>Keep up-to-date antivirus, anti-malware, firewall and possibly download a network monitor to view your network traffic for unusual activity.
    </p></div>

    <div class="threats"><h2>Malware </h2><p>A program or software with malicious code, designed to infiltrate or damage a user’s computer or network.</p> 
    <p>Malware can come in many different forms</p>
    <p>i.	Viruses – Malicious programs disguised or hidden within other programs that can replicate themselves, they can damage or modify data.</p>
    <p>ii.	Worms – Similar to viruses but often spread through email.</p>
    <p>iii.	Trojans – Malicious programs disguised as legitimate programs, cannot spread by themselves instead trick users into executing the program.</p>
    <p>iv.	Spyware ¬– Malicious programs that monitor user activity on a host or network such as personal information and banking details and return the information to the attacker.</p>
    <p>v.	Ransomware – Malicious programs that attempt to extort money from the victim, different levels of ransomware with some being ineffective and some encrypting files and documents until ransom is paid.</p>
    <h2> Solution</h2>  <p>Keep up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware.</p>
    <p>Use caution when downloading or opening files/links/attachments.</p>
    <p>Do not click pop-ups.</p>
    <p>Only use freeware from legitimate sources.</p>
    <p>Be careful with website URLs.</p> <img src="/img/warning-2168379_640.png" alt="Malware Warning" class="center"></div>
   

    <div class="threats"><h2>Social Engineering </h2><p>Social engineering is a term referring to the manipulation or tricking of someone into giving out personal details.</p> 
    <p>These three different methods of social engineering attacks are generally used together but can work independently.</p>
    <p>i.	Blagging – An attacker will create an imaginary scenario to fool a victim into disclosing personal details. E.g. Nigerian prince fraud/an attacker claiming to be your bank or position of authority.</p>
    <p>ii.	Phishing – An attacker will send emails and texts to their victims attempting to manipulate personal details generally through links. E.g. A fake lottery or prize draw/impersonating a bank.</p>
    <p>iii.	Pharming – An attacker will create domain names very similar to popular websites and clone them, they will also send out fake links that will re-direct to their domain fooling people into entering their details. E.g. Ebayy.com domain name which looks identical to the eBay website.</p>

    <h2> Solution</h2>  <p>Be vigilant online when releasing personal details.</p>
    <p>Use caution when downloading or opening files/links/attachments.</p>
    <p>Be careful with website URLs.</p>
    <p>Be vigilant if using a public computer.</p>
    <p>Do not be fooled by something online that seems too good to be true.</p><img src="/img/hack-3671982_640.jpg" alt="Hacking Bank Details" class="center"></div>

    <div class="threats"><h2>Misconfigured Access Rights</h2><p>This is where incorrect permissions are set up allowing unauthorised individuals to view data or information not authorised to them.</p> 
    <h2> Solution</h2>  <p>Setting up the correct access rights and permissions on a computer or network when used by many different users is essential for data privacy and integrity.</p></div>

    <div class="threats"><h2>Unpatched and/or outdated software</h2><p>Attackers can gain access to your system by finding bugs and exploits in older versions of software or even the latest version.</p> 
    <h2> Solution</h2>  <p>Always keep your antivirus, antimalware and the majority of programs you use up-to-date with the latest versions and patches.</p></div>

    <div class="threats"><h2>Default and Weak Passwords </h2><p>A very common way for an attacker to gain access to computer when using default and weak passwords.</p> 
    <h2> Solution</h2>  <p>There are many sites and tools available to create a random selection of characters for you, but a good password should follow the general guideline;</p>
    <p>•	A mix of upper and lower case characters</p>
    <p>•	Special characters/symbols</p>
    <p>•	Numbers</p>
    <p>•	Contain at least 8 characters</p>
    <p>•	Not something that is easily guessed by knowing you</p>
    <p>•	Not a word</p>
    <p>•	Ideally have different passwords on different websites and change them regularly</p><img src="/img/log-in-3938432_640.jpg" alt="Login Credentials" class="center"></div>
