            <h4>Social Engineering</h4>
            <img class="cardimgr" src="img/sec2/socialengineering.jpg" alt="A victim of hacking"/>
            <p class="cardpl">In the context of cyber security, what we are referring to when we say, 'social engineering', is the people behind the attacks on systems. If we have a bank system, and we’re trying to protect it against hackers, it’s important to understand who will be attacking it. What do they want? How will they try to do it?
              An attacker might simply be an opportunist, thinking they’ll be lucky enough to get away with it. They could be career intellectual attackers, who are highly technically competent. They could be emotional attackers, looking to make a statement. They may be terrorists, looking to intimidate and gain visibility, or they may simply be insiders who know the ins and outs of the system.
              There are several ways in which a system may be attacked. Information may be taken and used for personal gain or leaked to the public. Data or software may be removed from the system. They may tamper with data or software within the system, changing how it functions without our knowledge. Lastly, they may vandalise the system, in order to put it completely out of service.

            <h4>Risk Management</h4>
            <img class="cardimgl" src="img/sec2/riskmanagement.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p class = "cardpr">Working out risk involves identifying what assets a business has, the vulnerabilities those assets have, and what the threats are to those assets. Vulnerabilities to a system may be found in the hardware the system is built on, or the software in use on the system. There may also be vulnerabilities in the data that is in use on the system, or the people that are using it.
              When it comes to addressing risk, there are a few options on how to do so: try to prevent threats by closing vulnerabilities or blocking attacks; deter by making attacks harder to perform; deflect by offering another more attractive target for attack; detect attacks as they happen or soon after. Each of these are ways of reducing the vulnerability of the system, or the impact of an attack, but equally important is how a business recovers from an attack.

            <h4>Security Training</h4>
            <img class="cardimgr" src="img/sec2/securitytraining.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p class="cardpl">Security training is an important step to take in any business. If employees don’t know how to enforce proper security, attacking the business can be trivial. Training should be tailored to the various levels of employees, and educate them on what they should be doing, as well as how they should be doing it.
              For general users, they will need to know good fundamental computer security practices. Managers should be educated on how to make decisions involving trade offs between risk, costs, and benefits. Executives need to know the risk management goals for their business. The risk of any threat to a business can be calculated using the following formula: risk = impact x likelihood of occurence.

            <h4>Incident Response</h4>
            <img class="cardimgl" src="img/sec2/incidentresponse.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p class="cardpr">It is essential for businesses to have procedures in place to respond to security incidents. These procedures should reflect on the potential consequences of an incident and suggest a suitable response. Having these procedures in place in advance of incident occurences can help to avoid panic and mitigate potential damages to the business. Companies may employ Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT), who are responsible for detecting incidents, minimising loss, mitigating any weaknesses of the system that were exploited, and restoring computing services. It can be useful to have IPS or IDS software in place to protect the system. IPS stands for Intrusion Prevention System, which is designed to block and filter any activity sent to the network that it views as being a threat. It aims to stop any malicious activity before it can effect the network. IDS stands for Intrusion Detection System, which is designed to monitor and analyse network traffic with the aim of identifying malicious activity and logging it to better identify future threats.</p>
