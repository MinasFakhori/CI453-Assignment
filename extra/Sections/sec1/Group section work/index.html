    <h2>Encipherment</h2>
    <img src="images/encipherment.jpg" alt="encipherment">
    </div>
  <p>This is hiding and sealing data which allows it to be more confidential. This is achieved by turning data into a numerical form or applying mathematical calculations and algorithms creating unreadable information. The techniques known to do this are Encipherment and Cryptography. Typically, advanced encryption depends on the algorithm used for Encipherment.</p>
    <h2>Access Control</h2>
    <p>This mechanism is in place to make sure that data cannot be accessed by people that should not have access. This is achieved by applying passwords, using pins or using firewalls so that hackers cannot breach the system. For example, if someone wanted to access private information they would have to get authorisation through the company by accessing passwords only known to them.</p>
 
 
    <h2>Notarisation</h2>
    <p>This security mechanism Is used act as a mediator between the sender and receiver so that information cannot be conflicted. This is typically done by a trusted third party and the mediator is requested to keep record of all requests that are made by the made sender.</p>
 
 
    <h2>Data Integrity</h2>
    <p>Data integrity is important as it needs to be consistently verified. This is a security mechanism because if the data remains consistent it means that the data is reliable and not coming from a malicious source. This is achieved by sending information known to both sending and receiving parties and checked before and after the data has been received.</p>

    <h2>Authentication Exchange</h2>
    <p>This security mechanism is in place to make sure that the correct parties are allowed to access information but only if the identity is known in communication. This achieved at the TCP/IP layer where a two-way handshake mechanism is in place.</p>

    <h2>Bit Stuffing</h2>
    <p>This is adding extra bits in data that is transmitted. The security mechanism is achieved at the receiving end when it comes back as an even or odd parity.</p>


    <h2>Digital Signature</h2>
    <p>- This security mechanism is achieved by adding a digital letter that is not visible and can only be checked through an electronic receiver. This is basically an electronic signature that is used to preserve data which is not more confidential, but the sender’s identity must be notified.</p>
